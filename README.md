# Density-Estimation

we will discuss density estimation. Observations in a dataset are often generated by a random process, e.g., a dataset consists of points in R generated independently under a Gaussian/normal distribution of mean 0 and variance 1. But at the beginning you do not know the underlying distribution. Density estimation refers to the process of, when given those observations, estimating what the underlying distribution is. The topics in this week include:

1. Parametric Density Estimation
2. Learning Mixtures of Gaussians by Expectation-Maximization algorithm
3. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
